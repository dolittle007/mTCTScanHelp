Generally, we divided the evidences of mutations associated drug sensitivity into following four categories, including  \n\n\n\n\nAltered Sensitivity [Hit]: The mutation exactly hits the known mutation that influences drug response\n\n\nCell Line Evidence: The gene in the mutation locus matches the significant gene-drug sensitivity in cell line level pharmacogenomics screens\n\n\nAltered Sensitivity [Match]: The mutation matches the known mutations (like mutation combination, or degenerative sequence) that associates drug response\n\n\nAltered Sensitivity [Overlap]: The mutation overlaps the known mutations (like large mutations, or structural variants) that associates drug response\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the importance of evidences, mTCTScan rank the qualified mutations in a table.
