Two allele frequency database are supported including 1000 Genomes project phase 3 and ExAC\n\n\n\n\nSnpEff parameters\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe used SnpEff to annotate cancer mutations, and users can select and filter the undesired variant features\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nJob tracking\n\uf0c1\n\n\nmTCTScan supports job retrieving from two manners\n\n\nFixed job URL\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nBrowser cookies in the Job menu\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrioritization result\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMutation prioritization\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor each mutation at the transcript level, mTCTScan utilizes an evidence-based scoring strategy to prioritize the mutations associated with drug sensitivity. \n\n\nFirst, mTCTScan uses a series of matching strategies to connect each mutation-affected transcript to our collected mutation-cancer drug association records, including \nExact Match\n, \nPartial Match\n, \nSmall-scale Overlap\n and \nLocus-based Overlap\n.\n\n\n\n\nExact Match\n requires that the genomic coordinates or protein effect of query mutations are exactly the same as our collected records\n\n\nPartial Match\n asks that protein effect of query mutation refers to same amino acid change with  collected records, or the genomic coordinates or protein effect of the query mutation exactly match one or part of the record\u2019s mutations (some records require the concurrence of multiple mutations)\n\n\nSmall-scale Overlap\n means that the genomic coordinates of query mutation overlaps with collected records at small insertions or deletions (Indel) scale\n\n\nLocus-based Overlap\n describes that the genomic coordinates of query mutation overlaps with collected records at structure variations scale. \n\n\nIn addition, mTCTScan would also search through cancer functional events and drug sensitivity associations which are from cell line data by matching query mutation to related cancer functional events. \n\n\n\n\nIn order to retrieve all relevant evidences of different levels, mTCTScan would map every mutation to each of above categories. \n\n\nSecond, each association record contains a confidence level with five grades including\n\n\n\n\nProven\n\n\nClinical trial stage\n\n\nCase report stage\n\n\nPreclinical stage\n\n\nInferential stage\n\n\n\n\nThen, for each mutation, by considering both the matching degree and the confidence level of association records, an evidence-based ensemble score would be calculated. According to this score, mTCTScan would rank all qualified mutations (mutations match with at least one record) in a table. User can click the \nDetails\n button to get more information\n\n\n\n\nCancer drug classificaiton\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor each drug/compound, mTCTScan would compare whether the mutations' impacts on drug sensitivity are consistent or conflicting across all associated mutations at the \"Exact Match\" and \"Partial Match\" levels. Based on the following criteria, drugs/compounds were divided into three categories\n\n\n\n\nIncreased Sensitivity\n indicating that mutations consistently increase this drug\u2019s sensitivity or response\n\n\nReduced Sensitivity\n indicating that mutations consistently decrease this drug\u2019s sensitivity or response\n\n\nConflicting Sensitivity\n indicating that at least one mutation modulates sensitivity or response of this drug in an opposite direction comparing with others.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, mTCTScan uses the number of associated mutations as the order to present drugs in each category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutation annotations\n\uf0c1\n\n\nmTCTScan reports all related mutation-affected gene transcripts.\n\n\n\n\nUsers can click each mutation record to expand the annotation panel.\n\n\n\n\nEleven different annotation fields are provided, which include basic \nMutation Information\n, \nGermline Allele Frequency\n (from 1000 Genomes project, ExAC, UK10K, ESP project), somatic recurrence rate from \nTCGAs\n, \nICGC\n and \nCOSMIC\n, clinical associated mutations from \nClinVar\n, functional predictions including \nNonsynonymous Functional Prediction\n, \nSplicing Functional Prediction\n and \nNon-coding Functional Prediction\n and base-wise \nConservation\n.\n\n\nFor example, user can click \nClinVar\n item to inspect detailed information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutation-cancer drug association\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAssociation detail\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor each mutation-affected transcript, user can check the \nDetails Implication\n button to get all associated records\n\n\n\n\nFor each transcript, a \nlollipop-style diagram\n and tabs to display \ndifferent levels of matched evidences\n are provided.\n\n\nMoreover, for each association record, addition tabs are provided to display \nMutation Association Summary\n, \nDrug \n Therapy Information\n and \nClinical Trial Information\n related to the drug.\n\n\nLollipop-style diagram\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLollipop-style mutation diagrams to visualize variant position in protein functional domain\n\n\n\n\nDifferent levels of matched evidences\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor each query mutation, four levels of matching strategies were used to retrieve records from our database\n\n\n\n\nMutation Association Summary\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nDrug \n Therapy Information\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nClinical Trial Information\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nGene-Drug Information\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor each mutation-affected transcript, mTCTScan also reports related drugs/compounds information based on the relationship between drugs and their gene targets.
